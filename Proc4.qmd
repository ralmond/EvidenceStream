## The Four Processes

@Proc4 described an idealized model of an assessment as consisting of four
processes.  @Streaming updated this model to work with a streaming system.  The 
focus is on assessments which are capturing data about the process in which the 
learner solves a particular problem.  The architecture allows for the processes to 
be on different computers (or computer/human systems) which communicate through the 
internet.  Figure @fig-proc4 shows the four processes.

The evidence capture process (originally called the presentation process) is what
the learner interacts with.  It is responsible for noting interesting bits of what 
the learner does, called _events_.  It passes these events to the evidence 
identification process.

Each event occurs within a scoring [context](Context.qmd).  The evidence 
identification process examines all events within a scoring context and identifies
a number of _observable_ features of the performance.  It then passes these 
observables to the evidence accumulation process.

The evidence accumulation process maintains an estimate of the student proficiency.
After each message containing observables from the evidence identification 
process, it updates that student model.  It then passes on statistics (estimates of 
the proficiency) to the activity selection process.

The activity selection process looks at the statistics from evidence accumulation 
and makes two decisions:  (1) what activity (problem) should the learner attempt 
next, or (2) has enough information been gathered so that the assessment can stop.
If the assessment is adaptive (that is the sequence of assessment activities is not
predetermined, then it sends a message back to the evidence capture process about what it should do next.
